# rvml -- min-caml compiler with let-polymorphism

`rvml` is a min-caml compiler that implements let-polymorphism.
rvml's polymorphic type inference is implemented in level-based algorithm discovered by Didier RÃ©my.
Code generation can generate codes with polymorphic types.

## Require

`llvm-11.0.1`

In macOS, you can install llvm with Homebrew.

```
$ brew install llvm
```

If you use other OS or architecture, you may need to build llvm from source. See [https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html).

## Build

```
$ cargo build
```

## Run

```
$ cargo run

...

input>> `you can write code here`
```

Compiler will generate object file named `main` that can link to generate executable file.
For example:

```
$ cargo run

...

input>> let rec f x = x in if f (f true) then f 42 else f 2

$ gcc -o main main.o
$ ./main
$ echo $?    # This should put 42.
```

## Examples

### let polymorphism

```ocaml
let rec f x = x in if f (f true) then f 42 else f 2
```

### fibonacci number

```ocaml
let rec fib n = if n < 2 then 1 else (fib (n - 1)) + (fib (n - 2)) in fib 10
```

### factorial

```ocaml
let rec fact n = if n = 0 then 1 else n * (fact (n - 1)) in fact 5
```

### tuple

```ocaml
let rec f x = (x, x, x) in let (a, b, c) = f 3 in a + b + c
```

## Todo

- [ ] Support nested function
- [ ] Add float type and its operator
- [ ] Call external function
